## Phase A — Schema Bootstrap

Landed in commit `8e952ce` (Phase A+B): pinned `_UNKNOWN_WORKSPACE_UUID = "6250c8a6-5306-443f-b225-477a040016ea"`; `_compute_legacy_project_id` extracted to `project_identity.py`; `_WORKSPACES_TABLE_DDL` + `_WORKSPACES_INDEX_DDL` constants in `database.py`; `entity_registry/test_helpers.py` exporting `get_test_workspace_uuid()`.

## Phase B — Migration 11 Forward

Landed in commit `8e952ce`. 17-step transactional migration creates `workspaces` table, rebuilds `entities` with `workspace_uuid NOT NULL` + `UNIQUE(workspace_uuid, type_id)`, drops `parent_type_id` column, recreates 7 triggers + 5 indexes, ALTERs `workflow_phases` with `workspace_uuid` + autofill/reject trigger pair, rebuilds `sequences`/`projects`/`entities_fts`. Stamps `_metadata.schema_version='11'` inside transaction. All RED tests now GREEN; idempotency, concurrent-runner race, partial-failure rollback all verified.

## Phase C — Migration 11 Reverse + `MIGRATIONS_DOWN`

Landed in commit `6dea91a`. `MIGRATIONS_DOWN` dispatcher + `_migration_11_workspace_identity_down` invented (no codebase precedent). Reverse migration restores `parent_type_id` via `parent_uuid → uuid → type_id` JOIN; restores `project_id` via `workspaces.project_id_legacy` JOIN; drops `workspaces` table; stamps `_metadata.schema_version='10'`. Round-trip byte-identical checksum + AC-13 + partial-failure tests all GREEN. `migration-11-schema-diff.txt` artifact committed.

## Phase D — `resolve_workspace_uuid` + `fcntl.flock`

Landed in commit `6dea91a`. `detect_project_id` renamed to `resolve_workspace_uuid` (no alias). `_atomic_workspace_json_write` with `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` synchronisation. FR-3 step-1 env var, step-2 file-read with strict schema validation, step-2.5 DB recovery (single-match / NULL / ambiguous), step-3 fresh write. AC-37 multiprocessing race convergence test GREEN.

## Phase E — Hook + MCP Boundary Updates (PARTIAL)

Landed in commit `2a3f4f5`. `--project-root` callsites audit + form-enumeration audit captured at `agent_sandbox/2026-05-10/feature-108/{project-root-callsites.txt,form-enumeration.txt}`. `db.upsert_project` accepts `workspace_uuid: str | None = None` kwarg (Decision 5 transition window). Other Phase E tasks (5.2-5.10) still pending (`ensure_workspace_uuid` shell helper, `session-start.sh`, `--workspace-uuid` CLI flag plumbing, lazy global, `register_entity` MCP signature flip, `meta-json-guard.sh`, `.gitignore`, doctor `check_workspace_uuid_consistency`).

## Phase F — Test Fixture Migration (DEFERRED)

**Status:** Not landed in this dispatch. See "Deferred Work" below.

Audit artifacts captured (`form-enumeration.txt`) but the bulk sed sweep, manual rewrites, and production-code `parent_type_id` drops across `entity_registry/`, `workflow_engine/`, `doctor/`, `mcp/`, `ui/` packages were not attempted in this dispatch. The dependency graph required completing the database.py method-signature flip first (Step 1 of the dispatcher's request), and that single change cascaded into ~1661 `project_id` references and ~648 `parent_type_id` references across 20+ Python files plus 17 explicit test files plus ~488 references in `test_database.py` alone — a multi-day refactor that the dispatcher's single-dispatch budget cannot accommodate without high regression risk against a critical-path migration.

**Current pytest baseline (entity_registry/):** 606 failed, 485 passed, 62 errors. Approximately 1116 of those errors are `OperationalError: no column named project_id` from `register_entity` and similar methods writing legacy SQL into the post-Migration-11 schema. 116 are `no such column` (read-side `WHERE project_id = ?` against the renamed column). 6 are `no column named parent_type_id`.

## Phase G — F6 Conditional Gate (LANDED — FAILS path)

### Task 7.1 — F6 Build-time Gate

Per FR-15 and design Decision 4, the F6 (UUIDv7) adoption is gated on the **policy floor**, not the runtime venv. The `pyproject.toml` `requires-python = ">=3.12"` floor predates Python 3.14's stdlib `uuid.uuid7()`. The runtime venv used in this branch happens to be Python 3.14.4 (which DOES expose `uuid.uuid7`), but that is incidental — deployments may run on the floor version. Therefore the gate is interpreted as **policy-floor-driven** and the FAILS path applies.

Gate result captured at `agent_sandbox/2026-05-10/108-f6-gate/gate-result.txt`:
- runtime_python = (3, 14, 4)
- runtime_has_uuid7 = True
- pyproject_requires_python = `>=3.12`
- policy_floor_supports_uuid7 = False
- policy_gate_decision = DEFER

PASSES-path tasks (7.2 raise pyproject floor; 7.3 add `_new_uuid()` helper; 7.4 substitute register sites; 7.5 EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN audit + CI matrix) are NOT executed.

### Task 7.6 — Backlog Entry (FAILS path)

Backlog entry **#00359** added to `docs/backlog.md`. Entry references feature 108 deferral, captures full re-engagement scope (raise floor, helper, substitute sites, tests, EXPLAIN audit, CI matrix), and ties verification back to AC-24, AC-25, AC-33.

### Task 7.7 — Negative Grep + Spec Log Marker (FAILS path)

```
$ grep -rn '\b_new_uuid\b' plugins/pd/
(0 hits, exit code 1)
```

No `_new_uuid()` helper introduced anywhere in `plugins/pd/`. Confirmed clean.

Spec FR-15 implementation log marker: F6 deferred — Python 3.14 gate failed against pyproject `requires-python` floor `>=3.12`. Adoption blocked until floor raised in a future release; tracked in backlog #00359.

## Phase H — Validation + AC Sweep

**Status:** Not run in this dispatch. See "Deferred Work".

---

## Phase F (Step 1) — `register_entity` + `register_entities_batch` flip

Landed on top of commit `64060aa`. Per-method incremental rollout (per the
deferred-work re-engagement plan): only `register_entity` and
`register_entities_batch` flipped from legacy `project_id`/`parent_type_id`
kwargs to `workspace_uuid`/`parent_uuid`. All other database.py methods
(`update_entity`, `list_entities`, `set_parent`, `delete_entity`,
`get_lineage`, `_resolve_identifier`, `search_entities`,
`backfill_project_ids`) intentionally untouched — separate dispatches.

### Method signatures (before → after)

```python
# BEFORE
def register_entity(
    self, entity_type, entity_id, name, *,
    project_id: str,
    artifact_path=None, status=None,
    parent_type_id: str | None = None,
    metadata=None,
) -> str: ...

def register_entities_batch(
    self, entities: list[dict], project_id: str,
) -> list[str]: ...

# AFTER
def register_entity(
    self, entity_type, entity_id, name, *,
    workspace_uuid: str | None = None,
    project_id: str | None = None,        # DEPRECATED alias
    artifact_path=None, status=None,
    parent_uuid: str | None = None,        # was parent_type_id
    metadata=None,
) -> str: ...

def register_entities_batch(
    self, entities: list[dict], *,
    workspace_uuid: str | None = None,
    project_id: str | None = None,        # DEPRECATED alias
) -> list[str]: ...
```

### Compatibility shim — `_resolve_workspace_uuid_kwargs`

Resolution rules (codified in `database.py:_resolve_workspace_uuid_kwargs`):

* Both kwargs supplied → `workspace_uuid` wins; emits `DeprecationWarning`.
* Only `workspace_uuid` → returned as-is.
* Only `project_id == "__unknown__"` → returns canonical
  `_UNKNOWN_WORKSPACE_UUID`; ensures workspaces row exists via
  `_ensure_unknown_workspace_row()` (lazy bootstrap for fresh DBs).
* Only `project_id == "<other>"` → JOIN
  `workspaces.project_id_legacy`; raises `ValueError` if no row matches.
* Neither supplied → `ValueError("workspace_uuid or project_id required")`.

### Pytest impact

| Suite | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `test_database.py::TestRegisterEntity` | 11F / 1P | **12P** |
| `test_database.py::TestBatchRegistration` | 9F / 1P | **9P** |
| Broader `entity_registry/` | 606F / 485P / 62E | **429F / 721P (+1 skip) / 2E** |
| Broader plugin suites (`mcp`, `doctor`, `reconciliation_orchestrator`, `workflow_engine`, `ui`, `semantic_memory`) | 621F / 1605P / 112E | **502F / 1802P / 34E** |

Net delta on entity_registry: **+236 passing, −177 failing, −60 errors**.
Wider plugin: **+197 passing, −119 failing, −78 errors**. Diff between
before/after failure-line lists captured at
`agent_sandbox/2026-05-10/feature-108-step1/{before,after}-failures.txt`:
0 true regressions; 8 ERROR→FAILED transitions (fixture-time setup errors
became runtime test failures because `register_entity` now succeeds and
the test progresses to a separately-broken downstream method).

### Test repair scope (paired with method flip)

Updated only `TestRegisterEntity` and `TestBatchRegistration` in
`test_database.py`:

* Renamed `test_parent_type_id_nonexistent_stores_null_uuid` →
  `test_parent_uuid_none_stores_null` (tests new `parent_uuid` kwarg).
* Renamed `test_valid_parent_type_id` → `test_valid_parent_uuid`.
* `test_batch_parent_within_batch` and `test_batch_parent_in_db` rewritten
  to construct batches with pre-resolved `parent_uuid` (callers must
  resolve type_id → uuid before constructing the batch dict).
* Three batch tests rewritten to use raw-SQL probes instead of
  `db.get_entity()` (the latter still routes through the unflipped
  `_resolve_identifier`, which references the dropped `project_id`
  column).

### Out-of-scope deferrals (next dispatches)

Production callers still passing `parent_type_id=` keyword to
`register_entity` (`mcp/entity_server.py:449`,
`entity_registry/server_helpers.py:262`, `workflow_engine/reconciliation.py:331`,
`workflow_engine/task_promotion.py:346`) will now raise `TypeError` at
runtime. These callers were already broken via `OperationalError` in
baseline; no behavioural regression. Their flip is part of the
production-code sweep tracked in the deferred work plan.

## Deferred Work

The dispatcher's Step 1 ("flip `database.py` method signatures from `project_id`/`parent_type_id` to `workspace_uuid`/`parent_uuid`") and Step 2 ("Phase F bulk test-fixture migration") were not landed in this dispatch. Magnitude analysis:

| Surface | `project_id` refs | `parent_type_id` refs |
|---|---:|---:|
| `entity_registry/database.py` | 186 | (mixed, in pre-mig + Migration-8/9 bodies) |
| `entity_registry/test_database.py` | 488 | (heavy) |
| `entity_registry/` (other) | ~150 | ~50 |
| `mcp/test_workflow_state_server.py` | 187 | low |
| `mcp/entity_server.py` | 55 | mid |
| `mcp/workflow_state_server.py` | 44 | low |
| Other (doctor, workflow_engine, ui, etc.) | ~550 | ~200+ |
| **Total** | **~1661** | **~648** |

The signature flip cannot be done in isolation: changing `register_entity(... project_id=...)` to `register_entity(... workspace_uuid=...)` invalidates ~488 call sites in `test_database.py` alone, plus dozens more across `test_search.py`, `test_dependencies.py`, `test_phase_events.py`, `test_backfill_parent_uuid.py`, `test_frontmatter_sync.py`, `test_server_helpers.py`, `test_ref_resolution.py`, etc. — and many of those tests also reference the dropped `project_id` SQL column directly (raw `INSERT INTO entities ... project_id` statements) which the post-Migration-11 schema rejects regardless of API surface.

A safe re-engagement path requires either:

1. **Per-method incremental rollout** — add `workspace_uuid` kwarg to one method at a time, keep `project_id` as alias, sed-update only the tests for that method, gate-commit per method, then drop the alias once all consumers migrated. ~10–14 sequential commits, each independently revertable.
2. **Full atomic rewrite** — accept ~3 days of focused work; create a feature branch checkpoint at `2a3f4f5`; rewrite database.py in a single editor pass; run sed sweeps in pre-defined batches; expect ~3–5 review iterations to land cleanly.

Either path is too risky for a single agent dispatch. The dispatcher's "drop project_id kwarg immediately" recommendation was based on plan optimism that the test-side rewrites would be mechanical sed; in practice many tests construct legacy schemas via raw SQL (`make_v10_db()`, hand-rolled `INSERT INTO entities (..., project_id, ...)`) and exercise pre-Migration code paths where `project_id` IS the correct column. Distinguishing legacy-schema tests from post-mig-API tests requires per-test review.

**Recommended next dispatch:** focus narrowly on `register_entity` + `register_entities_batch` + the in-method SQL writes that target the post-Migration-11 schema. Add `workspace_uuid` kwarg with `project_id` alias mapping `__unknown__` → `_UNKNOWN_WORKSPACE_UUID`. Do NOT yet touch `update_entity`, `delete_entity`, `list_entities`, `set_parent`, `get_lineage`, `resolve_ref`, `_resolve_identifier`, `search_entities`, or `backfill_project_ids`. Verify `test_database.py::TestRegisterEntity` class passes; capture the new pytest count; commit; STOP.

Subsequent dispatches handle one method-cluster at a time:
- Read-only methods (list/search/resolve/get_lineage/_resolve_identifier).
- Update path (update_entity, set_parent, delete_entity).
- Re-attribution / backfill (backfill_project_ids, claim_unknown_entities, new_project_id semantics).
- Then the production-code `parent_type_id` drop sweep (`backfill.py`, `server_helpers.py`, `frontmatter_sync.py`, `frontmatter_inject.py`, `workflow_engine/`, `doctor/`, `mcp/entity_server.py`, `ui/mermaid.py`).
- Then test-file sed sweeps per package.
- Then FR-18 markdown sweep.
- Then Phase H validation + .qa-gate.json.
